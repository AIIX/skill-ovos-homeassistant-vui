Control Your Home via Home Assistant

## About
Home Assistant is an open-source platform for automating smart home devices. It provides a centralized control system for all connected devices, allowing you to manage and monitor them from one place. This skill provides an voice interface for the OpenVoiceOS Home Assistant PHAL Plugin: https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-PHAL-plugin-homeassistant.

** Note: This skill does not directly talk to any homeAssistant instance. It needs the phal plugin installed and setup before this skill can be useful. **

** Note: This is very much *WIP* and does not still provide the full functionality for every device, currently it only supports turning on and turning off devices and light devices control, others are work in progress. **

## Examples
* "turn on the bedroom lights"
* "turn off the bedroom 2 lights"
* "increase the brightness of garage lights"
* "decrease the brightness of garage lights"
* "change the kitchen lights to green"
